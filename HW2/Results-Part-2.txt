Reason of change in accuracy:
	There will be slight chnage in accuacy if filter stopwords or not.
	This will be increase or decrease depending on the testing and training data sets as follows:
		Let's say stopword "a" occurs more times in spam than in ham in both training and testing data sets and 
		have less occurences in ham in both training and testing data set. In this case, the stopword "a" is helping 
		towards correct classifications. But if this is not the case, it'll hurt the accuracy.
	This will also be dependent on choice of words in stopwords list. For example, in this perticular case, the word "subject" appears 
	both in spams and hams equally hence it doesn't provide much information.
